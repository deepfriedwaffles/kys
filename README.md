# kys
sudo rm -rf --no-preserve-root in a quick command! Gone are the days of having to type out that whole command to murder your computer in a fit of anger, now, simply run 1 quick command!!

this isn't a joke. running "kys" after installing WILL destroy your filesystem and everything in it! to people who aren't orwell, be careful.

otherwise, if you are orsell, please feel free to run this command

install like this
git clone https://github.com/deepfriedwaffles/kys
cd kys # [or wherever u installed it]
chmod +x install.sh
./install.sh
